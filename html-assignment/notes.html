    <p>Imporatant to remember most of this is just for context and accessibility.</p>

                <p><em>A mental map of how to use the following tags for myself to remember the contextual uses here. </em></p>  
                <p><b>&lt;ol&gt;</b> Ordered List! Exactly as it sounds since it uses numbers.</p>
                <p><b>&lt;ul&gt;</b> Unordered List! The exact opposite of an ordered list with no numbers or priority.</p>
                <p><b>&lt;li&gt;</b> This is the bread and butter that actually puts in either the numbers or dash/dots for the list. You can use several and they are generally placed within either an ordered list or unordered list. </p>
                <p><b>&lt;dl&gt;</b> Description List! Pretty much sets the boarders for a description tag.</p>
                <p><b>&lt;dt&gt;</b> Description Terms! Pretty much generally used for the title!. .</p>
                <p><b>&lt;dd&gt;</b> Description Details! Where you'd pull the details and real grit of it all, duh. .</p>

                <p><em>A mental map of how to use the following tags for myself to remember the contextual uses here. P.S. Note to self, don't forget about <em>&lt;Header&gt;</em> when choosing what to use!</em></p>  
                <p><b>&lt;Main&gt;</b> can only be used once on a page and cannot be a child of most elements like the following (article, footer, header, nav), and is good to use if you're working with accessability.</p>
                <p><b>&lt;Div&gt;</b> Even more general then section, it's great for miscellaneous use.</p>
                <p><b>&lt;Article&gt;</b> For independent content. E.g. Blog posts, news articles, forums.</p>
                <p><b>&lt;Section&gt;</b> More general, can be used for anything that needs to be sectioned off. .</p>
